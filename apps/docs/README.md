# Verse Documentation

Verse Documentation is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### Installation

If you followed [Verse Contributing](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) and installed the project dependencies, you should already have Docusaurus installed.

### Local Development

Make sure that `apps/docs` is your current working directory and run the following command:

```
pnpm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.
