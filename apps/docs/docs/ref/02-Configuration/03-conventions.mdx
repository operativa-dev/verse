# Conventions

Verse employs the concept of "convention over configuration" to reduce the amount of boilerplate configuration that needs
to be written. This means that the framework makes assumptions about how your application is structured, and provides
sensible defaults for these assumptions. This allows you to focus on writing the code that is unique to your application,
rather than spending time on boilerplate code.

The conventions that Verse uses are as follows:

## BooleansToOneOrZero

When a boolean property is defined on an entity, it is assumed that this property is mapped
to a column in the database that will represent this boolean as a 1 or 0. This convention is
used when the target database does not directly support a boolean type.

## ColumnFromPascalCasedPropertyName

When a property is defined on an entity, the column name that this property is mapped to in the database
is assumed to be the pascal-cased version of the property name. For example, a property named `firstName`
will be mapped to a column named `FirstName`.

## ColumnTypeFromProperties

The type of the column in the database is inferred from the values of various properties on the entity. For example,
if a property is of type `string` and has a `maxLength` attribute with a value of 50, then the column in the database
will be of type `VARCHAR(50)`.

## DateAsTimestamp

When a property is of type `Date`, it is assumed that this property is mapped to a column in the database that
will represent this date as a `timestamp`. This convention is used when the target database does not directly support
a date type.

## DateAsTimestampWithTimeZone

When a property is of type `Date`, it is assumed that this property is mapped to a column in the database that
will represent this date as a `timestamp with time zone`. This convention is used instead of `DateAsTimestamp` when
the target database supports timezones.

## DatePropertyToISOString

When a property is of type `Date`, it is assumed that this property should be serialized to and deserialized from
a string in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss.sssZ`. This is the format that is used by the `Date` object's `toISOString`
method. This convention is used when that target database does not directly support a date type.

## DefaultSequence

For databases that support sequences, properties can be configured to use a sequence as the default value via
Verse's built-in support for the hi-lo pattern ("seqhilo"). This convention creates the database sequence that
will be used by default.

## ForeignKeyFromEntityNameAndPrimaryKeyName

When two entities have a relationship, the foreign key column in the database is assumed to be named after the
name of the entity that the foreign key references, followed by the name of the primary key column on that entity.
E.g. if an entity named `Album` has a relationship to an entity named `Artist`, and the primary key of `Artist`
is `id`, then the foreign key column on the `Album` table will be named `ArtistId`.

## ForeignKeyFromPrimaryKeyName

When two entities have a relationship, the foreign key column in the database is assumed to be named after the
name of the primary key column on the entity that the foreign key references. E.g. if an entity named `Album`
has a relationship to an entity named `Artist`, and the primary key of `Artist` is `albumId`, then the foreign key
column on the `Album` table will be named `albumId`.

## ForeignKeyOnDelete

Sets the default behavior for the `ON DELETE` clause of foreign key constraints. If any property of the foreign key
is required, the `ON DELETE` clause will be set to `CASCADE`. Otherwise, it will be set to `SET NULL`.

## IdentityKey

Sets the default identity generation strategy for a single, numeric key column to "identity". This convention is used
when the target database supports identity columns.

## MaxLengthDefault

Sets the default maximum length for a string property to 255, or 36 if the string property is being used to
store a UUID.

## NavigationForeignKeyFromDependent

Configures the foreign key used by navigation properties between entities. If there is a single foreign key set up
between the two entities, set it as the foreign key for the navigation properties.

## PrecisionScaleDefaults

Sets the default precision and scale for numeric (non-integer) properties to 18 and 4, respectively.

## PrimaryKeyFromProperty

Tries to discover the primary key property of an entity by looking for a property named `id` or `<entityName>Id`.

## PropertiesAreNotNullable

Makes all properties on an entity not nullable by default.

## SeqHiloKey

Sets the default identity generation strategy for a single, numeric key column to `seqhilo`. This convention is used
when the target database supports sequences. Depends on the `DefaultSequence` convention to create the sequence.

## TableFromEntityName

Sets the default table name for an entity to be entity name.

## UseSingleTableInheritance

Sets the default inheritance strategy to "single table inheritance". Entity inheritance hierarchies are mapped
to a single table in the database, with a discriminator column to differentiate between the different types of entities.

## UuidPropertyToBuffer

When a property's configure column type is `uuid`, it is assumed that this property should be serialized
to and deserialized from a `Buffer`. This convention is used when the target database does not directly
support a UUID type, but is instead using a `BINARY(16)` column to store the UUID.

## VersionProperty

Looks for an integer property named `version` on an entity and sets it as the version property for
optimistic concurrency.
