# Overview

Verse configuration involves specifying things like a database driver and connection information, as well
as defining a _metadata model_ that describes the structure of your application's data, and how it maps
to your database schema. Verse is a pure runtime library, so there is no code generation step to slow down
your development process. Instead, you define your metadata model in code, and then use it to interact with
your database.

# Verse Object

A `Verse` object is the main entry point for using the framework. There is normally a single `Verse` object per
application, scoped at the top level of your application code.

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/config.ts:verse-object showLineNumbers
const db = verse({
  config: {
    //...
  },
  model: {
    //...
  },
});
```

The [`verse`](../../api/verse/functions/verse) function is used to create a new `Verse` object.
It takes an object with two properties:

- `config`: An object that specifies configuration such as the database driver to use.
- `model`: An object that specifies the metadata model for the application.

# Config

The [`config`](../../api/verse/type-aliases/Config) object is used like this:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/config.ts:config showLineNumbers
const db = verse({
  config: {
    driver: sqlite(`Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite`),
    logger: new PrettyConsoleLogger(),
  },
  model: {
    //...
  },
});
```

Here we are using the `sqlite` driver to connect to a SQLite database file named `Chinook_Sqlite.sqlite`. We
are also enabling logging to the console using the `PrettyConsoleLogger`, which is a built-in logger that
formats log messages in a human-readable way.

# Model

The `model` object is used to define the metadata model for the application. The model is primarily a collection of
_entity_ models, which represent the concepts in your application domain. Each entity has a name, and a set of properties
that describe the structure of the entity. The model can also define _value objects_, which are simple objects that are
used to represent data that doesn't have an identity of its own, and _sequences_, which are used to generate unique identifiers.

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/config.ts:model showLineNumbers
const db = verse({
  config: {
    //...
  },
  model: {
    entities: {
      artists: entity(
        {
          artistId: int(),
          name: string(),
        },
        builder => {
          builder.table("Artist");
        }
      ),
    },
  },
});
```

Here we are defining an entity that represents artists in a music database. The entity has two properties: `artistId` and `name`.
Each entity is given a label in the model, in this case `artists`, which is used to refer to the entity in queries. We also
use the optional `builder` function to specify that the entity maps to a table named `Artist` in the database.

These configuration objects are of course just plain JavaScript objects, so you can define them in any
 way that is convenient for you.

For example, you could define the entity configuration separately and then reference it in the model. In fact, this is
sometimes necessary when you have circular references between entities.

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/config.ts:separate-config showLineNumbers
const Artist = entity(
  {
    artistId: int(),
    name: string(),
  },
  builder => {
    builder.table("Artist");
  }
);

const db = verse({
  config: {
    //...
  },
  model: {
    entities: {
      artists: Artist,
    },
  },
});
```

In the next sections, we will drill down into the details of the configuration objects that can be used to define
the metadata model.
