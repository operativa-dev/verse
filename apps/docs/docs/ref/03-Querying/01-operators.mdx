# Operators

Verse provides many query operators to help you write sophisticated queries. This section will describe
the built-in operators and how to use them.

## all

The `all` operator is used to check if all of the elements in a sequence satisfy a given condition:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:all showLineNumbers
const all = await db.from.artists.all(a => a.name !== "AC/DC"); // false
```

## any

The `any` operator is used to check if a sequence contains any elements:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:any showLineNumbers
let any = await db.from.artists.where(a => a.name === "AC/DC").any(); // true
```

There is a shorthand for the common case above:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:any-pred showLineNumbers
any = await db.from.artists.any(a => a.name === "AC/DC"); // true
```

## array

The `array` operator is an aggregate operator that collects all the elements in a sequence into an array:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:array showLineNumbers
const array = await db.from.artists.array().first(); // true
```

Aggregation happens on the database side, usually using a JSON array aggregation function such as `json_agg` in PostgreSQL.

## avg

The `avg` operator is an aggregate operator that calculates the average of a sequence of numbers:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:avg showLineNumbers
let avg = await db.from.artists.select(a => a.artistId).avg();
```

There is a shorthand for the common case above:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:avg-short showLineNumbers
avg = await db.from.artists.avg(a => a.artistId);
```

## count

The `count` operator is an aggregate operator that counts the number of elements in a sequence:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:count showLineNumbers
const count = await db.from.artists.count();
```

## distinct

The `distinct` operator is used to remove duplicate elements from a sequence:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:distinct showLineNumbers
const distinct = await db.from.artists
  .select(a => a.name)
  .distinct()
  .toArray();
```

## first

The `first` operator is used to get the first element of a sequence:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:first showLineNumbers
let first = await db.from.artists.where(a => a.name === "AC/DC").first();
```

There is a shorthand for the common case above:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:first-pred showLineNumbers
first = await db.from.artists.first(a => a.name === "AC/DC");
```

## groupBy

The `groupBy` operator is used to group elements in a sequence by a key:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:group-by showLineNumbers
const groupBy = await db.from.albums.groupBy(a => a.artistId).toArray();
```

Each group is represented as a key-value pair where the key is the group key and the value
is an array of the elements in the group.

You can also perform aggregation on the groups:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:group-by-agg showLineNumbers
const albumCounts = await db.from.albums
  .groupBy(
    a => a.artistId,
    g => ({
      artist: g.key,
      count: g.count(),
    })
  )
  .toArray();
```

## join

The `join` operator is used to join two sequences based on a common key:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:join showLineNumbers
const joined = await db.from.artists
  .join(db.from.albums, (ar, al) => ar.artistId === al.artistId)
  .select((ar, al) => ({
    artist: ar.name,
    album: al.title,
  }))
  .toArray();
```

`join` returns a sequence of pairs where the first element is from the first sequence and the second
element is from the second sequence. Subsequent operators (like the `select` operator above) will
automatically destructure the pairs into separate parameters when the operator accepts an arrow function.

## leftJoin

The `leftJoin` operator is used to join two sequences based on a common key, returning all elements from the
first sequence, and the matching elements from the second sequence:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:left-join showLineNumbers
const leftJoined = await db.from.artists
  .leftJoin(db.from.albums, (ar, al) => ar.artistId === al.artistId)
  .toArray();
```

Join returns a sequence of pairs where the first element is from the first sequence and the second
element is from the second sequence, or `undefined` if there is no match. As with `join`, subsequent operators will
automatically destructure the pairs into separate parameters when the operator accepts an arrow function.

## limit

The `limit` operator is used to limit the number of elements in a sequence:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:limit showLineNumbers
const limit = await db.from.artists.limit(5).toArray();
```

Limit queries are automatically parameterized to improve performance and security.

## max

The `max` operator is an aggregate operator that calculates the maximum of a sequence of numbers:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:max showLineNumbers
let max = await db.from.artists.select(a => a.artistId).max();
```

  There is a shorthand for the common case above:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:max-short showLineNumbers
avg = await db.from.artists.max(a => a.artistId);
```

## maybeFirst

The `maybeFirst` operator is used to get the first element of a sequence, or return `undefined` if the sequence is empty:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:maybe-first showLineNumbers
let maybeFirst = await db.from.artists
  .where(a => a.name === "Allan Holdsworth")
  .maybeFirst();
```

There is a shorthand for the common case above:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:maybe-first-pred showLineNumbers
maybeFirst = await db.from.artists.maybeFirst(
  a => a.name === "Allan Holdsworth"
);
```

## maybeSingle

The `maybeSingle` operator is used to get the only element of a sequence, or return `undefined` if the sequence is empty:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:maybe-single showLineNumbers
let maybeSingle = await db.from.artists
  .where(a => a.name === "Allan Holdsworth")
  .maybeSingle();
```

This operator will throw an error if the sequence contains more than one element.

There is a shorthand for the common case above:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:maybe-single-pred showLineNumbers
maybeSingle = await db.from.artists.maybeSingle(
  a => a.name === "Allan Holdsworth"
);
```

## min

The `min` operator is an aggregate operator that calculates the minimum of a sequence of numbers:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:min showLineNumbers
let min = await db.from.artists.select(a => a.artistId).min();
```

  There is a shorthand for the common case above:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:min-short showLineNumbers
avg = await db.from.artists.min(a => a.artistId);
```

## offset

The `offset` operator is used to skip a number of elements in a sequence:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:offset showLineNumbers
const offset = await db.from.artists.offset(5).toArray();
```

Offset queries are automatically parameterized to improve performance and security.

## options

The `options` operator is used to specify query options:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:options showLineNumbers
const options = await db.from.artists
  .options({ disabledConditions: "all" })
  .where(a => a.name === "AC/DC")
  .toArray();
```

It may only be used at the beginning of a query.


## orderBy

The `orderBy` operator is used to sort elements in a sequence:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:order-by showLineNumbers
const ordered = await db.from.artists.orderBy(a => a.name).toArray();
```

## orderByDesc

The `orderByDesc` operator is used to sort elements in a sequence in descending order:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:order-by-desc showLineNumbers
const orderedDesc = await db.from.artists.orderByDesc(a => a.name).toArray();
```

## select

The `select` operator is used to project elements in a sequence:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:select showLineNumbers
const select = await db.from.artists.select(a => a.name).toArray();
```

Complex projections are supported:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:select-complex showLineNumbers
const selectComplex = await db.from.albums
  .select(a => ({
    id: a.albumId,
    desc: `Title: ${a.title}`,
    props: [a.artistId],
  }))
  .toArray();
```

Verse will push down projection expressions to the database when possible (such as the template literal above).
The example above will be translated to SQL as:

```sql showLineNumbers
select "t1"."AlbumId", 'Title: ' || "t1"."Title" as "c0", "t1"."ArtistId"
from "Album" as "t1"
```

The rest of the required projection processing (i.e creating each result object) will be performed on the client side.

## single

The `single` operator is used to get the only element of a sequence:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:single showLineNumbers
let single = await db.from.artists.where(a => a.name === "AC/DC").single();
```

Single will throw if there are no elements in the sequence, or if there is more than one element.

There is a shorthand for the common case above:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:single-pred showLineNumbers
single = await db.from.artists.single(a => a.name === "AC/DC");
```

## sql

The `sql` operator is used to execute a raw SQL query:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:sql showLineNumbers
const name = "AC/DC"; // usually from user input, parameterized

const sql = await db.from.artists
  .sql`SELECT * FROM Artist WHERE Name = ${name}`.toArray();
```

It is a useful escape hatch for when you need to execute a query that is not supported by the Verse query API.

## sum

The `sum` operator is an aggregate operator that calculates the sum of a sequence of numbers:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:sum showLineNumbers
let sum = await db.from.artists.select(a => a.artistId).sum();
```

There is a shorthand for the common case above:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:sum-short showLineNumbers
sum = await db.from.artists.sum(a => a.artistId);
```

## toArray

Buffers the sequence into an array:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:to-array showLineNumbers
const toArray = await db.from.artists.toArray();
```

By default, sequences are lazy and will not execute until the query is iterated, or a terminal operator like `toArray` is called.

## where

The `where` operator is used to filter elements in a sequence:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:where showLineNumbers
const where = await db.from.artists.where(a => a.name === "AC/DC").toArray();
```

## with

The `with` operator is used to specify one or more navigation properties that should be eager loaded:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:with showLineNumbers
let eager = db.from.artists.limit(1).with(a => a.albums);

for await (const artist of eager) {
  console.log(artist);
}
```

See the [Eager Loading](./eager-loading) section for more information.
