# Overview

Querying in Verse is based on a fluent, compositional, pipeline-style API. This means that you chain together a
series of discrete operations to build up a complete query. This is similar to how you might build a pipeline in a
shell script, or a series of method calls in a programming language. This approach is designed to be easy to read and
write, and to have excellent tooling support and type safety.

For example:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:40-43 showLineNumbers
const artists = await db.from.artists
  .where(a => a.name.like("A%"))
  .select(a => a.name)
  .toArray();
```

In this example, we start by querying all artists with `db.from.artists`, then we use the `where` operator to filter
the
results to only include artists whose name starts with "A", and then we apply the `select` operator to project just the
`name` property from the results. Finally, we call `toArray` to execute the query and buffer the results into an array.

Instead of buffering with `toArray`, you can also use a `for await` loop to iterate over the results in a streaming
fashion, which can be more efficient for large result sets:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:45-51 showLineNumbers
const query = db.from.artists.where(a => a.name.like("A%")).select(a => a.name);

for await (const name of query) {
  console.log(name);
}

const acdc = await db.from.artists.where(a => a.name === "AC/DC").first();
```

We can also use the `first` operator to get the first result, or `single` to get the only result:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:53-59 showLineNumbers
const alanis = await db.from.artists
  .where(a => a.name === "Alanis Morissette")
  .single();
```

The difference between `first` and `single` is that `single` will throw an error if there is more than one result.

:::note

Both `first` and `single` will throw an error if there is no result. To return `undefined` instead,
we can use the `maybeFirst` or `maybeSingle` operators.

Verse supports a wide range of other operators, including `orderBy`, `groupBy`, `join`, `limit`, `offset`, among others. We'll cover these in more detail in the following sections.
