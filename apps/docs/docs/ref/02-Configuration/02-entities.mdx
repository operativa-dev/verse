# Entities

Entities are the primary building blocks of a model, and correspond to the core concepts in your application domain,
such as users, products, orders, etc. Entities have identity, and are uniquely identifiable by their primary key. They
are made up of fields, which represent the properties of the entity, and relationships, which represent the associations
between entities.

In Verse, entity models are created using the [`entity`](../../api/model/builder/functions/entity) configuration function,
which is used, along with other configuration functions, to define a complete entity model. The following example
demonstrates how to define a simple entity model for a user:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/entities.ts:user showLineNumbers
const User = entity({
  id: int(),
  name: string(),
  email: string(),
});
```

Once created, we can add it to the model by simply adding it to the `entities` object in the model configuration:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/entities.ts:model showLineNumbers
const db = verse({
  config: {
    // ...
  },
  model: {
    entities: {
      users: User,
    },
  },
});
```

:::note

We could have just as easily defined the entity directly in the model configuration, but it's often better to
define it separately, especially when the model is large or the entity is involved in relationships.

:::

Observe that when we add an entity to the model, we associate it with a `label`, in this case `users`. This label is used
to refer to the entity when we are doing things like querying data.

E.g. it lets us write queries like `db.from.users.where(u => u.name === 'Alice')`.

## Objects vs. Classes

At runtime, Verse entities can either be plain objects or class instances. By default, entities are plain objects, but
you can also use classes to represent entities. This can be useful when you want to add methods to your entities, or when
you want to use inheritance to define common behavior.

To use a a class to define an entity, you can simply pass the class constructor to the `entity` function:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/entities.ts:class showLineNumbers
class User {
  constructor(
    readonly id: number,
    public name: string,
    public email: string
  ) {}
}

const user = entity(User, {
  id: int(),
  name: string(),
  email: string(),
});
```

In this case, we define a `User` class with a constructor that takes the properties of the entity as arguments. We then
pass the class constructor to the `entity` function, along with the configuration object that defines the properties of
the entity.

:::note

All configuration APIs that accept entity types can also accept class constructors.

:::

Whether or not you use classes to define entities is largely a matter of personal preference, but there are some things
that you can do with classes that you can't do with plain objects:

* Use inheritance to define common behavior.
* Create entities with stricter APIs. e.g. by making properties read-only.
* Use _shadow properties_ to represent properties that are not present in the class definition.
* Easily create circular references between entities.
* Perform in-line model configuration.

## Entity Types

When using plain objects to define entities, we would like a type that represents the shape of the entity. Verse
provides a utility type, [`EntityType`](../../api/verse/type-aliases/EntityType), that generates a type for an
entity. This type can be used to type-check entities and queries, and to provide additional tooling support.

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/entities.ts:type showLineNumbers
type UserType = EntityType<typeof db.entities.users>;
```

## Circular References

Entities can have relationships with other entities, and these relationships can form a graph of entities that reference
each other. This is known as a _circular reference_, and can be useful for representing complex relationships between
entities. When using class-based entities, this is not a problem, as classes can reference each other directly. However,
when using plain objects, we need to use a different approach to handle circular references, because TypeScript does not
perform type-inference for types containing circular references.

The pattern we need to use looks like this:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/entities.ts:circular showLineNumbers
type PostType = {
  readonly id: number;
  userId: number;
};

const User = entity({
  id: int(),
  posts: many<PostType>("Post"),
});

const Post = entity({
  id: int(),
  userId: int(),
  user: one(User),
});

const db = verse({
  config: {
    // ...
  },
  model: {
    entities: {
      users: User,
      posts: Post,
    },
  },
});
```

We can see that the main difference is that we have had to explicitly define the type of the `Post` entity, and then
pass it to the `many` function when defining the `posts` navigation property on the `User` entity. Additionally, we
have had to pass the name of the `Post` entity to the `many` function, so that Verse can resolve the entity that the
navigation is referencing. The name of an entity is just the singularized, pascal-cased version of the entity label,
and is used internally by Verse to identify entities.

## Properties

As shown above, properties are specified by passing a configuration object to the `entity` function. The configuration
object keys are the names of the properties, and the values are calls to type-specific configuration functions. In this
case, we used the [`int`](../../api/model/builder/functions/int) and [`string`](../../api/model/builder/functions/string)
functions to define the `id`, `name`, and `email` properties. There are also configuration functions for defining
other types of properties, such as `boolean`, `date` and `number`.

These scalar property configuration functions are also used to define how the property behaves and how it should be
mapped to the database.

For example we can can override the default column name for a property:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/entities.ts:column showLineNumbers
const User = entity({
  id: int({ column: "user_id" }),
  name: string(),
  email: string(),
});
```

Or set the maximum length of a string property:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/entities.ts:length showLineNumbers
const User = entity({
  id: int(),
  name: string({ maxLength: 255 }),
  email: string(),
});
```

## Shadow Properties

When using class-based entities, we can define _shadow properties_ on the entity to represent properties that are not
present in the class definition, but are used by the entity model. Shadow properties are useful for things like
optimistic concurrency control, where we need to store a version number for the entity, but don't want to expose it
as a property on the class.

For example, we can define a shadow property for the `User` entity to represent the version number:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/entities.ts:shadow showLineNumbers
class User {
  constructor(
    readonly id: number,
    public name: string
  ) {}
}

const user = entity(
  User,
  {
    id: int(),
    name: string(),
    version: int(),
  },
  e => e.concurrency({ version: "version" })
);
```

Verse will treat the `version` property just like any other property, but it will not be present in the type of the
entity, and so will not be visible to consumers of the entity.

## Navigations

Navigations are entity properties that reference other entities. They are used to represent relationships between
entities so that we can enjoy a rich and natural programming model that reflects the data structure of our application domain.
Specifically, they allow us to do things like: eager load related data, query across relations without the need for manual joins,
and update aggregate roots with their children in a single transaction.

For example, a `User` entity might have a `posts` navigation property that references a collection of `Post`
entities that the user has created.

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/entities.ts:navigations showLineNumbers
const Post = entity({
  id: int(),
  title: string(),
  content: string(),
});

const User = entity({
  id: int(),
  name: string(),
  email: string(),
  posts: many(Post),
});
```

We use the [`many`](../../api/model/builder/functions/many) function to define a navigation property that references a
collection of entities. We can also use the [`one`](../../api/model/builder/functions/one) function to define a navigation
property that references a single entity.

## Key

Entities have a primary key, which is a unique identifier for the entity. By default, Verse tries to infer the primary
key based on the properties of the entity using [conventions](Conventions/overview). However, you can, of course,
explicitly specify the primary key using configuration:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/entities.ts:key showLineNumbers
const User = entity(
  {
    id: int(),
    name: string(),
    email: string(),
  },
  e => e.key("id")
);
```

In this case, we explicitly specify that the `id` property is the primary key of the entity by calling the `key` method
on an entity configuration builder object. We pass a function that takes the entity configuration builder as the second
argument to the `entity` function.

## Foreign Keys

Foreign keys are used to define relationships between entities at the database level, and underpin things like navigations
and cascading updates. In Verse, foreign keys are defined using the `references` method on the entity configuration builder:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/entities.ts:fks-1 showLineNumbers
const User = entity({
  id: int(),
  //...
});

const Post = entity(
  {
    id: int(),
    userId: int(),
    //...
  },
  e => e.references(User)
);
```

Observe that, in this case, we don't need to specify the column name for the foreign key property, as Verse will infer it
using conventions. However, we can override the default behavior by specifying the column name explicitly:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/entities.ts:fks-2 showLineNumbers
const User = entity({
  id: int(),
  //...
});

const Post = entity(
  {
    id: int(),
    userFk: int(),
    //...
  },
  e => e.references(User, "userFk")
);
```

Here, the foreign key property is named `userFk`, and so will not be automatically inferred by Verse. We need to specify
the column name explicitly when calling the `references` method.

## Table

We can also specify the table name for an entity, using the same fluent configuration builder function:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/entities.ts:table showLineNumbers
const User = entity(
  {
    id: int(),
    name: string(),
    email: string(),
  },
  e => e.table("users")
);
```

:::note

In Verse, explicit configuration is often not necessary, as the framework can infer most of the configuration from
conventions. However, explicit configuration can be useful when you need to override the default behavior.

:::

## Concurrency

Entities can also have a concurrency property, which is used to implement _optimistic concurrency_ control. This is a
mechanism to prevent lost updates in a multi-user environment. When an entity has a concurrency property, Verse will
automatically include it in the `WHERE` clause of `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements, and check that the value has not
changed since the entity was last read.

To specify a concurrency property, we can use the `concurrency` method on the entity configuration builder:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/entities.ts:concurrency showLineNumbers
const User = entity(
  {
    //...
    token: int(),
  },
  e => e.concurrency({ version: "token" })
);
```

Here, we specify that the `token` property is the concurrency property for the entity. The `version` option is used to
specify that we are using the _version_ strategy for concurrency control. This means that the property is expected to
be a monotonically increasing value, and will be incremented by one each time the entity is updated. Verse will
manage this for us automatically.

## Conditions

Entities can also have conditions, which are filters that are automatically applied to any queries for that entity.
Conditions are specified using the `condition` method on the entity configuration builder:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/entities.ts:condition showLineNumbers
const User = entity(
  {
    //...
    deleted: boolean(),
  },
  e => e.condition(user => !user.deleted)
);
```

Conditions are useful for implementing cross-cutting concerns, such as soft deletes, where entities are not actually
deleted from the database, but are instead marked as deleted by setting a `deleted` flag to `true`. By adding a
condition to the entity, we can ensure that developers do not have to remember to filter out deleted entities in their
queries.

## Seed Data

Entities can also have seed data, which is initial data, defined at the model level. Verse will automatically insert
this data into the database when the database is created. Seed data is specified using the `data` method on the entity
configuration builder:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/entities.ts:seed-data showLineNumbers
const User = entity(
  {
    id: int(),
    name: string(),
    email: string(),
  },
  e =>
    e.data(
      { id: 1, name: "John", email: "john@example.com" },
      { id: 2, name: "Jane", email: "jane@example.com" }
    )
);
```

Seed data is useful for populating the database with initial data, such as reference data, that is required for the
application to function correctly. It can also be used for testing purposes, to ensure that the database is in a known
state before running tests.
