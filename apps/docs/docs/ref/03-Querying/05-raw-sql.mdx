# Raw SQL

Sometimes Verse's powerful query operators aren't enough. If this happens, you can drop down
and write raw SQL queries. This is done using the special tagged template literal `sql` function, available
at the start of any query.

For example, a simple raw SQL query might look like this:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:sql showLineNumbers
const name = "AC/DC"; // usually from user input, parameterized

const sql = await db.from.artists
  .sql`SELECT * FROM Artist WHERE Name = ${name}`.toArray();
```

This will execute the raw SQL query `select * from Artist where Name = ?` with the parameter `AC/DC`.

## Composition

A powerful feature of raw SQL queries is that they can be composed with other operators. This allows you to
use raw SQL queries as building blocks for more complex queries.

For example, chaining additional operators to a raw SQL query is as simple as chaining them to any other query:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:sql-composition showLineNumbers
const composed = db.from.artists.sql`SELECT * FROM Artist`
  .where(a => a.name.like("A%"))
  .orderBy(a => a.name)
  .limit(5)
  .toArray();
```

which will produce the following SQL query:

```sql showLineNumbers
select "t4"."ArtistId", "t4"."Name"
from (
   SELECT * FROM Artist
) as "t4"
where "t4"."Name" like 'A%'
order by "t4"."Name"
limit ?
```
