# Getting Started

Let's get started with the basics of Verse by creating a simple application that uses a SQLite database.

Verse supports different databases using separate packages. For this example, we will use the `@operativa/verse-sqlite` package. Create a new directory for your project and install the package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @operativa/verse-sqlite
```

Now, create a new file called `index.ts` and add the following code:

```ts title=index.ts

```
