# Eager Loading

Eager loading allows you to efficiently load graphs of related objects in a single Verse query. It is useful
when you know that you will need access to the related objects as part of a single operation, such as rendering
a view. Eager loading can be used to avoid the N+1 query problem.

Eager loading in Verse is specified using the `with` query operator. The `with` operator takes an expression that
specifies the related navigations to load. E.g.

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:with showLineNumbers
let eager = db.from.artists.limit(1).with(a => a.albums);

for await (const artist of eager) {
  console.log(artist);
}
```

In this example, the `albums` navigation property will be eagerly loaded with the artist. It outputs:

```js
{
  artistId: 1,
  name: 'AC/DC',
  albums: [
    {
      albumId: 1,
      title: 'For Those About To Rock We Salute You',
      artistId: 1
    },
    { albumId: 4, title: 'Let There Be Rock', artistId: 1 }
  ]
}
```

Multiple navigations can be specified as part of a single `with` operation. E.g. load an
artist with their albums and tracks:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:with-multiple-1 showLineNumbers
const artistAlbumsTracks = db.from.artists
  .limit(1)
  .with(ar => ar.albums.with(al => al.tracks))
  .toArray();
```

Or, load a track with its album and artist:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:with-multiple-2 showLineNumbers
const trackAlbumArtist = db.from.tracks
  .limit(1)
  .with(t => t.album.artist)
  .toArray();
```

:::note

Verse uses a single query to load the related objects. This strategy is known as _Left Join Fetching_.
