# Navigations

Navigation properties may be used to easily construct queries that span entity relationships, avoiding
the need to manually join entities based on foreign keys relationships. This a powerful feature that allows you to
work with your data in a more natural way.

For example, we can query artists that have at least one album.

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:navigation showLineNumbers
const navigation = await db.from.artists
  .where(a => a.albums.length > 1)
  .toArray();
```

In this example, the `albums` property is a navigation property that allows us to query albums related to an artist,
Verse understands the `length` property and generates the appropriate SQL query.

```sql showLineNumbers
select "t1"."ArtistId", "t1"."Name"
from "Artist" as "t1"
where (
   select count(*)
   from "Album" as "t2"
   where "t1"."ArtistId" = "t2"."ArtistId"
) > 1
```

What if we want to query the names of any artists that have a track called "Today"?

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:navigation-2 showLineNumbers
const navigation2 = await db.from.tracks
  .where(t => t.name === "Today")
  .select(t => t.album.artist.name)
  .toArray();
```

Navigations work anywhere you have a reference to an entity, so you can even do things like this:

```ts include ./apps/snippets/src/query.ts:navigation-3 showLineNumbers
const navigation3 = await db.from.albums
  .select(a => ({ foo: { bar: a }, baz: a }))
  .where(o => o.foo.bar.artist.name === "Alice In Chains")
  .toArray();
```

Here, even though we are putting each album into the `foo.bar` property of an intermediate object, we are still able to
navigate to the related artist and filter on their name.
